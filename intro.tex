\section{Introduction}

%%% Zhao : The following thing is very irrevalent, I can't remember the purpose of the following thing.

%Given a directed graph $G(V,E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges. For every pair $u,v$, there is at most one directed between them.  Let $S$ denote a subset of $V$. We say vertex $u$ is the father of vertex $v$, if there is a directed path from $u$ to $v$. The goal is to output mapping $f : V \rightarrow \{0,1,2\}$ such that\\
%1. For each $v \in S$, $f(v) = 1$.\\
%2. For each $u,v$ if $u$ is the father of $v$, then $f(u) \leq f(v)$.
